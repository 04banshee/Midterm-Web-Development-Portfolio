<h1> Biographical Sketch of David Wiles using bold, emphasize, defining instance, abbrevations, blockquote, quote, subscript, superscript, strong, italcize, break, and horizontal rule</h1>
 	<p> David Wiles hails from California. Born and raised in a <em> small</em> town named <b>Oroville </b>. He graduated high school and tried his hand in the construction trade for a few years. Joining the military at age 25 was a challenge. In the military he saw the world and made a better life for himself. David excelled in the military and retired with an honorable discharge. 
	<dfn>The military has many discharges, and receiving an honorable discharge is what all service members strive to attain. </dfn> After 19 years of service  in the <abbr title="United States Marine Corps"> USMC David retired <b> Honorably </b> </abbr>.</p>
	
	<p> After the military David relocated to the Muscle Shoals/TriCities area with his wife <strong> Christy </strong>. The experience and skills David brought from the military did not transition to the local area. David contacted the Veterans Administration (VA) for assistance for locating <i> meaningful </i> career opportunities. The VA and David devised a Vocational Rehabilitation plan that included finishing his education. Under the plan, David is returning to school and finishing a degree in Information Technology (IT) he started while on active duty.<br /> Many of the concepts are familar to David but the math formulas like 2x<sup>2 </sup> + 3x where new challenging.  Science classes like wise where a challenge. Learing chemical fomulas like C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>is the fomual for glucose took a bit to master.
